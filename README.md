# Beer App

Using SwiftUI, I created a beer app that allows the user to document the beers they have drunk in a clear way.  
Using Core Data, the app functions even without an internet connection.  
Users can add custom pictures either by taking a photo or selecting one from the photo library.

The user can add a picture from the camera roll or by taking a new picture.  
All fields except for the notes section are mandatory.
